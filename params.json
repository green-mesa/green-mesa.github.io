{"name":"Green Mesa","tagline":"Javascript Components","body":"## HalogenJS\r\n\r\n[HalogenJS](https://halogenjs.org) is a HAL/HAL-O JSON framework for working natively with hypermedia resources in the browser. \r\n\r\n## Animation and Experimental Modules\r\n\r\nMany additional modules are available on Charlotte Gore's personal Github [here](http://github.com/charlottegore), which tend to be available on npm with the ```gm-``` prefix. \r\n\r\nThe modules are CommonJS with fluent interfaces, and many are intended for use for animation, games and web audio.\r\n\r\n## Dom / Value / Traverse / CSS\r\n\r\nGreen Mesa maintain forks of [component-dom](https://github.com/component/dom) and some of its dependencies which fixes issues around dealing with forms. This is a dependency for [HalogenJS](https://halogenjs.org) as we do not want to have jQuery as a dependency. \r\n\r\n## Route\r\n\r\nGreen Mesa maintain a fork of [component-route](https://github.com/component/route) in order to have it available as an npm package.\r\n\r\n## Hyperbone\r\n\r\nHyperbone is the a collection of components for a hypermedia framework that has since become [HalogenJS](https://halogenjs.org). These repositories are maintained so that they will continue to be available through Component, and they're also maintained as NPM packages.\r\n\r\n## Backbone \r\n\r\nBackbone refactored into individual components. A dependency for HalogenJS (and Hyperbone).\r\n\r\nWe have:\r\n\r\n- [Backbone Events](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-events)\r\n- [Backbone Model](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-model)\r\n- [Backbone Collection](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-collection)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
