{"name":"Green Mesa","tagline":"Javascript Components","body":"## Hyperbone\r\n\r\nHyperbone is a non-framework framework, built on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), for building client side applications consuming [JSON HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). \r\n\r\nBy 'Non-Framework', we mean that each component is distributed via the [Component package manager](https://github.com/component/component). Use one or all of the components as you see fit. \r\n\r\nActivity on this project is high at the moment. We hope to get a fully annotated demo application up and running soon.\r\n\r\n### [Hyperbone Model](https://github.com/green-mesa/hyperbone-model)\r\n\r\nBackbone models with Hypermedia extensions\r\n\r\n### [Hyperbone View](https://github.com/green-mesa/hyperbone-view)\r\n\r\nBind Hyperbone Models to the DOM, with special Hypermedia conventions.\r\n\r\n### [Hyperbone Form](https://github.com/green-mesa/hyperbone-form)\r\n\r\nGenerate styleable two-way bound HTML Forms from JSON `_controls` in your Hypermedia documents.\r\n\r\n### TODO: Hyperbone IO\r\n\r\nHyperboneIO deals with network interactions for Hypermedia documents - loading, reloading and sending `_controls` data to the server. \r\n\r\n### TODO: Hyperbone App\r\n\r\nRouting and bringing all the others together with some helpful conventions to all the actual building of apps.\r\n\r\n### TODO: Hyperbone Build\r\n\r\nComponent is a great package manager, but the build tool adds a significant file size overhead when dealing with a large number of Components. Hyperbone Build allows you to use Component as your package manager and compile your source as a self-bootstrapping application with minimal module related detritus. \r\n\r\n## Backbone \r\n\r\nWe have broken Backbone into discrete standalone modules so that Hyperbone can avoid loading unnecessary parts.\r\n\r\nWe have:\r\n\r\n- [Backbone Events](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-events)\r\n- [Backbone Model](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-model)\r\n- [Backbone Collection](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-collection)\r\n- [Backbone Sync](https://github.com/green-mesa/backbone-sync) - Warning: Also installs jQuery. Yikes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
